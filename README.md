patch for DWM that allows colors and draw rectangle in the DWM status bar

Usage
=====

**^rx,y,w,h^**: Draw a rectangle of width w and height h, with its top left corner at (x,y) relative the X drawing cursor.

**^c#FF0000^**: Set foreground color.

**^b#55cdfc^**: Set background color, only applies to text, simply use the ^r^ command to change the background while drawing.

**^f<px>^**: Forward the X drawing cursor by <px> pixel. Please bear in mind that you have to move the cursor enough to display your drawing (by the with of your drawing).

**^d^**: Reset colors to SchemeNorm.
